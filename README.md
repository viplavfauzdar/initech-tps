# Initech TPS Reports
## THD code test
An `Office Space` experience. :)

**Coding Exercise:**

You are working for a company called "Initech" on a web service with your coworker "Bill".   Bill just sent you an email that the customer contact field on the companies website is saving personal customer information in the clear.  The contact field on the website has the label "Email or Phone" with a character length of 80.  Bill has said the email domain does not have to be masked, but the customer's email must be masked except for the first and last character.  Bill said for phone numbers we need to mask the middle three digits and leave everything else in the clear.  Bill says he wants a simple method he can pass this data too and get a masked result back.  Bill also needs to see some test proof that this method works.  Bill just left for a vacation to Brazil, so document any assumptions that you think Bill would agree with.
